3.7.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- In version 3.7.2 msgids and default values where forced to be
  unicodes. This was too strict because at least the TAL extractor returns
  UTF-8 encoded default values. Fixed this by allowing the default value to
  be a string again.


3.7.3 (2012-01-06)
------------------

- i18nextract bugfix: _("msgid", mapping={...}) does not have a default, just
  like _("msgid").  Previously it would get a ``#. Default: ""`` annotation in
  the .pot file.


3.7.2 (2011-12-12)
------------------

- Handle Unicode msgids and default values.

- Consistent sorting of source filenames for each msgid.  Also sort line
  numbers numerically, not lexicographically.

------------------

- Fix nl translations.

- Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation [erico_andrei]

  packages via a `zcml` extra, added tests for zcml.

  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

  mailing list.

3.6.0 (2009-12-28)
