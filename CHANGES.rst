4.0.1 (2018-06-29)
------------------

- Add list of supported Python versions to Trove classifiers.


3.7.4 (2012-05-14)
------------------

- In version 3.7.2 msgids and default values were forced to be
  ``unicode``. This was too strict because at least the TAL extractor returns
  UTF-8 encoded default values. Fixed this by allowing the default value to
  be a string again.


3.7.3 (2012-01-06)
------------------

- i18nextract bugfix: _("msgid", mapping={...}) does not have a default, just
  like _("msgid").  Previously it would get a ``#. Default: ""`` annotation in
  the .pot file.


3.7.2 (2011-12-12)
------------------

- Handle Unicode msgids and default values.

- Consistent sorting of source filenames for each msgid.  Also sort line
  numbers numerically, not lexicographically.

------------------

- Fix nl translations.

- Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation [erico_andrei]

------------------

- Include zcml dependencies in ``configure.zcml``, require the necessary
  packages via a `zcml` extra, added tests for zcml.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


3.6.2 (2010-07-31)
------------------

- Updated copyright to `Zope Foundation`, even in pot template.

- Updated e-mail address in pot template to current address of zope
  mailing list.

3.6.1 (2010-05-17)
------------------

- Updated Dutch and German translations.

3.6.0 (2009-12-28)
------------------

- Added `configure.zcml` which registers the translations in the

------------------
